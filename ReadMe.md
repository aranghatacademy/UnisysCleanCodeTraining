##Code Smells
1. Use Cyclomatic Complexity to identify complex methods and refactor them.
2. Avoid long method parameters by avoiding primitive obsession.
3. Feature Envy: Move methods to the class they are most related to.
4. Utility Hell: Avoid overusing utility classes; Consider using services and DI
